                        <br /><br />I went from working as barista for 7 years (I can make a mean machiatto), to a Chemist, to Dental Assistant to now lead me here; a Software Developer!
                        <br /><br /> Development has rapidly become a place I feel challenged, excited, and eager to learn more and create better. A place where my creative mind and inner child can thrive. Hit the contact button and let's create something
                        cool together.
